# ABMLangBenchmarks
ABM language benchmarking

## Model:

A simple econophysics-like model: agents exchange randomly random sums of money.

## Benchmarking technicque:

The model is implemented in the same way (as best as I can) across different languages/platforms.

## Results (so far):

Num agents: 10000; Time steps: 1000:

Pyhton: 1hr+ (never finished)

Java: 59secs

C++: 6secs
